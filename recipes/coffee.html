        <h2>Coffee is coffee ya know. Ahh lovely, a mug of hot... java.</h2>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Cawffee beans or grounds, depending on your level of snobbery</li>
                <li>A nice mug</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Optional</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Milk, because you don't want to be a sick, sick, espresso drinker and have some self respect</li>
                    <li>Syrups, to taste something other than bitterness and regret</li>
                    <li>Chocolate dusting, because you're just a cute little cappucino enjoyer</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>Grind the beans or put the grains into the Portafilter (Yes, I'm assuming you have an actual coffee machine and are not an instant coffee consuming sub-human scum)</li>
                <li>Wait until the temperature light, lights up</li>
                <li>Press the button</li>
                <li>Stop after a bit</li>
                <li>Press the steaming wand button and wait for it to light up</li>
                <li>Steam the shit out of that milk, frothy, not frothy, spraying all over your kitchen? go mental!</li>
                <li>Put some sizzurp in there and shake a light chocolate dusting on top, preferably with a stencil of a happy face, or a cat, to improve taste</li>
                <li>Sip but keep your mouth closed, no one wants to hear you slurping ok</li>
                </ol>
